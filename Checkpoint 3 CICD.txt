 We have a javascript project and we need to create a CI-CD pipeline using Jenkins.
 
 task to do :

    Download and Install Jenkins
    Install Jenkins Plugins
    Create free style project and test installation with a simple project
    We need to try declarative pipeline with a front end angular project .
    Create a Jenkinsfile in your project and push it to github
    Get pipeline from github and make build
    
    
    our cloud VM is Ubuntu
    
    Jenkins on Ubuntu 18.04

    Step 1: Install Java
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
      
    Step 2: Add the Jenkins Repository
      #importing the Gnu Privacy Guard keys
      wget –q –O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add –
      sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
      #jenkins repositery
      deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary
      ##  save nano file
      
    Step 3: Install Jenkins
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install Jenkins 
      # response Y yes to install
      
      # verify if jenkins well installed
     sudo systemctl status jenkins
      # rsponse active with green color
     
    
    Step 4: Modify Firewall to Allow Jenkins
       # check if port 8080 is open 
    
    
    Step 5: Set up Jenkins
      http://104.215.78.258:8080           
      # 104.215.78.258 is our cloud VM adress  thanks to the instructor Ahmed
      # it can be ip_address_or_domain
      
      # to access to jenkins in the browser we have to copy the password from the following file
      
       sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
       
       #the password is a succession of alphanumeric characters
       # in the browser we aunlock jenkins access with this key
       
       #104.215.78.258:8080/login?from=%2F
       #after entering the code we install suggested plugins
       #inthe first hand we will be asked to create first admin user we create and continue
       # then we create the instance configuartion 
       # we make choice of free style project
